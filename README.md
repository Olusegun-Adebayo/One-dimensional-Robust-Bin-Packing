Python codes for the linear programming models in my Master's thesis:
python codes for the Kantorovich formulation, First Fit Decrasing algorithm, 
Probability of recovering a defect in a pattern when a defect is present at random
Probabilty of loosing at item in a pattern when a defect is present at random,
Expected economic loss on a pattern and consequentially in a pattern set of an optimal solution for an instance with defect present at random.
Heuristic models that tries to minimise the loss
